							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/auto_web.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I came into existence on 2nd of November 1999 in the town of Vikasnagar in outskirts of Dehradun city in the state of Uttarakhand. I completed my schooling up to class 12th, or you may say Intermediate, in Vikasnagar.</p>
							<p>Currently, I am pursuing my Dual Degree in the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras with a specialization in Automotive Engineering since the year 2017.</P>
							<p>I have always been a big fan of music and I have been singing since I was five. I performed at school functions for all my school years and after joining college I represented my hostel in music competitions.</p>
							<p>In my family, I have my parents, a brother and a sister. My friend circle is called Kasukabe Defence Group. I like to think of myself as a calm person with a lot of interests, sometimes makes me unclear, and a belief in goodness. This may seem a little old fashioned but I believe in hard work.</p>

							<h2>Work Samples</h2>
							<p>Several programming languages can be used for Machine Learning including Python, Java, R, C++ and more. Out of these, the most popular one is Python and that is also my first choice followed by R.
							<br>The framework I generally use is Google Colab, which is best in my understanding. <br>
                            Following are short introductions to some of the important processes and model types in ML.</p>

									<h3>ML App Deployment</h3>
									<p>I worked on an Automotive data about Cars called <b>Auto MPG Data</b> for Regressive prediction about the MPG or Miles Per Gallon Performance metric of a car.
									I used Flask and Heroku to Deploy this ML App on a website. Click on the link below to know more.</p>

									<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
									<p>Biggest slice in the pie of total time that a data scientist spends on his/her model is undoubtedly feature engineering. The data we get is not always the way we want it to be. Many times it goes through processes of feature selection, feature extraction etc to make it as perfect as possible.</p>
								</section>
				
								<section>
									
									<h3>Regression</h3>
									<p>Regression in ML terms is when we use many data samples to train a model that predicts a number for a new data sample, and this model is called a regression model of ML. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
								
									<h3>Classification</h3>
									<p>Classification in ML terms is when we use many data samples to train a model that predicts a category/class for a new data sample.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Clustering</h3>
									<p>Clustering is an ML application of unsupervised learning, where we use a vast dataset to explore those patterns in data, which were previously unknown.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Deep Learning</h3>
									<p>Deep learning uses neural networks, which are a series of algorithms that learn the patterns in a dataset through a process that mimics the operation of a human brain.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Kaggle</h3>
									<p>Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and an awesome place to learn and grow. I have been using kaggle datasets for long and also participated in a few of competitions.<br>This is my kaggle profile: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ayush0299" target=”_blank” >Ayush Chauhan</a></p>

									<h3>Other models and samples</h3>
									<p>My other work samples include models based on association rule learning, reinforcement learning, model tuning, boosting and others.</p>
