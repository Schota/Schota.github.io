							<h1>Ayush Chauhan</h1>
							<p>This website is to help people familiarize with me and my skill set better.</p> My major interests include Machine Learning, Music, Automotive vehicles.
							I am currently pursuing my B.Tech at IIT Madras in the Department of Engineering Design. You can know me better in the upcoming sections.</p>

									<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
									<p>This article will give you some insight into my interactions with ML.
									<br>If you are interested in looking at my work samples, you are welcome to skip this and move to the next section.<br>
									But for those who are just starting with ML, maybe I can share some of my perspectives for you to explore it with more enthusiasm.</p>

							<h2>Work Samples</h2>
							<p>Several programming languages can be used for Machine Learning including Python, Java, R, C++ and more. Out of these, the most popular one is Python and that is also my first choice followed by R.
							<br>The framework I generally use is Google Colab, which is best in my understanding. <br>
                            Following are short introductions to some of the important processes and model types in ML.</p>
							<div class="features">
								
								<section>
									
									<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
									<p>Biggest slice in the pie of total time that a data scientist spends on his/her model is undoubtedly feature engineering. The data we get is not always the way we want it to be. Many times it goes through processes of feature selection, feature extraction etc to make it as perfect as possible. Preprocessing is the most important pat of entire machine learning process.</p>
								</section>
				
								<section>
									
									<h3>Regression</h3>
									<p>Regression in ML terms is when we use many data samples to train a model that predicts a number for a new data sample, and this model is called a regression model of ML. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
								
									<h3>Classification</h3>
									<p>Classification in ML terms is when we use many data samples to train a model that predicts a category/class for a new data sample.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Clustering</h3>
									<p>Clustering is an ML application of unsupervised learning, where we use a vast dataset to explore those patterns in data, which were previously unknown.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Deep Learning</h3>
									<p>Deep learning uses neural networks, which are a series of algorithms that learn the patterns in a dataset through a process that mimics the operation of a human brain.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Keggle</h3>
									<p>Keggle is an online community for data scientists and an awesome place to learn and grow. I have been using keggle datasets for long and also participated in a few of competitions.<br>This is my keggle profile: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ayush0299" target=”_blank” >Ayush Chauhan</a></p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Other models and samples</h3>
									<p>My other work samples include models based on association rule learning, reinforcement learning, model tuning, boosting and others.</p>
