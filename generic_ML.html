							<p>Being someone who is constantly interested in a lot of stuff, I had a hard time figuring out what my special skill should be. Generally never very stressed, I was quite tense about finding that one thing quickly. I tried graphic design, music production, coding and a lot of other things only to discover that out of these, I did fine at almost all but great at none.</p>
							<p>Then a close friend suggested me to try machine learning out. I was already fascinated by its vast applications and innovation at its core. I found ML to be the exact thing I wanted. It's a complete combination of mathematics and coding.</p>
							<p>I had a beginning way different than other people. I just jumped to Google's crash course on machine learning, which was all very new for me but at the same time, the content was so structured that with some stubbornness, I was able to finish the course and understand many important principles that are core to ML. I wouldn't suggest this to others though. You may lose your interest that way, for some people. You should first start with a Udemy course if you want to make it interesting and super easily understandable for you.</p>
							<p>Another important step in this beautiful experience of ML learning is the one where I am currently. The one where you reach after you complete a few courses on basic data preprocessing, model building, training and testing,  and parameter tuning. This part is when you join an online community for the enrichment of your knowledge. I don't think there is any place better than <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwir67WDqqfqAhUWb30KHZAzAbcQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw358aJVdRF5ENauJCrosrX1" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> for this. You can use a variety of dataset and test yourself. There are a lot of competitions where you can participate and improve with the help of discussions.</p>
